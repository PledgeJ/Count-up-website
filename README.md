# ðŸ“… Count up website

This is a website that I made to count the days since a date (which is currently set to my birthday). I made this website to test out a HTML design which is now the same as the one for my portfolio. This was also a way to experiment with dynamic layouts, and layouts for vertical devices, which you can see by resizing the window.\
**DISCLAIMER:** The javascript used to get the time since is not original, the main focus was on the HTML formatting
